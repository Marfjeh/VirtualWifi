# VirtualWifi
A tool make a Wi-Fi network with the Microsoft Hosted Network Virtual Adapter

## Why?
We all had this issue where your phone wouldn't connect to the router right? Well I had this issue and this application makes it possible for people with the same issue to share the laptop's wifi so you can freely browse the web and have chats with your friends again!


For now: you need to share your internet connection in network manager to enable Internet and Dhcp to work.

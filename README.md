## Why would I need this?
We all had this issue where your phone wouldn't connect to the router right? Well I had this issue and this application makes it possible for people with the same issue to share the laptop's wifi so you can freely browse the web and have chats with your friends again!

## Can I help?
Sure you can! Follow our project and make pull requests!

## Release date
There is no official date of release because this project is still being discussed and made. Any additional features could be removed at any time for fixing and more.

For now: you need to share your internet connection in network manager to enable Internet and Dhcp to work.
